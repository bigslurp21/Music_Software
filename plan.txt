Back-End Modules:

* Input audio
* Listen to audio
- how to take input and send it to output in real time?
* Project file system
* Project true time 
  - used for placement of audiofiles

Front End Design: (Can be done via html in a web-app like format)

Home page: Cool photos with box that says select project or create project

Project Page:
- Tracks (with amps) - w/ individual volume control (and eventually advanced time vol control)
- Metrenomoes (and advanced drum-like metrenomes)
- Sounds/files pool where you can store audio (ex songs, clips of songs, small musical parts etc)
- Effects pool (takes audio and transforms it) 





IT WOULD BE COOL TO MAKE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE CONTROLLED VIA THE MOUSE AND KEYBOARD 
...and midi keyboard input should instruments too with lots of libraries to choose from.
